# Blockchain-Based Smart City Infrastructure Management

## Overview

This blockchain-powered platform enables cities to efficiently manage, monitor, and maintain their infrastructure assets through a secure, transparent, and decentralized system. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, IoT integration, and smart contracts, the system provides real-time infrastructure monitoring, optimized maintenance scheduling, intelligent resource allocation, and comprehensive performance analytics to maximize service delivery while minimizing costs.

## Usage

### Asset Registration

City departments register infrastructure assets with detailed specifications.

```javascript
// Example asset registration
await AssetRegistrationContract.registerAsset(
  assetID,
  assetType, // road, bridge, utility, building, etc.
  geolocation,
  constructionDate,
  expectedLifespan,
  responsibleDepartment,
  technicalSpecifications,
  maintenanceRequirements
);
```

### Sensor Deployment

IoT sensors are registered and linked to specific infrastructure assets.

```javascript
// Example sensor registration
await SensorNetworkContract.registerSensor(
  sensorID,
  assetID,
  sensorType, // structural, environmental, traffic, etc.
  installationLocation,
  measurementParameters,
  updateFrequency,
  alertThresholds
);
```

### Data Collection

Sensors continuously submit infrastructure condition data to the blockchain.

```javascript
// Example condition data recording
await SensorNetworkContract.recordSensorData(
  sensorID,
  timestamp,
  measurements, // object containing sensor readings
  dataQualityMetric,
  dataSignature
);
```

### Maintenance Scheduling

The system generates optimized maintenance schedules based on asset conditions.

```javascript
// Example maintenance scheduling
const maintenanceSchedule = await MaintenanceSchedulingContract.generateSchedule(
  departmentID,
  timeframeStart,
  timeframeEnd,
  priorityLevels,
  availableResources
);
```

### Work Order Management

Maintenance tasks are created, assigned, and tracked through completion.

```javascript
// Example work order creation
await MaintenanceSchedulingContract.createWorkOrder(
  assetID,
  maintenanceType,
  scheduledDate,
  estimatedDuration,
  requiredSkills,
  priorityLevel,
  budgetAllocation
);

// Example work order completion
await MaintenanceSchedulingContract.completeWorkOrder(
  workOrderID,
  completionDate,
  actualCosts,
